### Theory


In this problem we have to write a program in C to implement a method that returns a structure including calling the method and using its value. Some keywords are used in this problem like char which declares a character and int which declares integer and array which is used to store a collection of variables of the same type. Mainly we used the structure function so that we can group the variables easily under one name in a block of memory by just declaring “struct”.
The useful components of this project are structures and user defined functions. A structure is a user defined data type in C. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.At the very beginning we create a structure named dim and initialised a variable for the 
same after which we created a second structure subject. Here ‘void’ is used as a function return type, it indicates that the function does not return a value.We passed one parameter for each of the function and a total of four.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

Time complexity is the computationalcomplexity that describes the amount ofcomputer time it takes to run an algorithm.The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
